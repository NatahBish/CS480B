1. I tend to use bad names when I'm flustered or rushing. 

I also tend to keep dead code either just doing nothing or commented out, although I do this 
so I can come back to them if they are needed again or I can use them to teach me.

you fidn what you are looking for.


3. I disagree with the positional markers becuase in a huge program it may help
